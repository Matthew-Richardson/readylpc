This project is a public-facing evacuation viewer for La Plata County. Residents start on a simple info homepage where they can see who’s in charge, learn what “Ready / Set / Go” means, and pick an active incident. From there, they jump into a focused incident page that shows a live ArcGIS web map, which zones are in SET or GO, and rich status details pulled from a Google Sheet (so non-technical staff can update wording without touching code). A shared stylesheet keeps everything visually consistent, and a small Apps Script turns spreadsheet rows into styled HTML cards.

Goal: Provide clear, mobile-friendly evacuation info that non-technical staff can keep up to date.

User flow:
  Land on info.html → see general guidance + list of active incidents.
  Tap an incident chip → go to evac.html?incident=Name.
  On evac page → see map, SET/GO zones, and a detailed status panel from Google Sheets.
Data sources:
  ArcGIS WebMap + FeatureLayer (LPC_Evac_Zones_View) for incidents and zones.
  Google Sheet (“IncidentStatus”) + Apps Script for status text, shelters, check-in, animals, etc.
Design:
  One shared CSS file for both pages and injected HTML (so everything looks like one app).
  Fully responsive, tuned for phones but still clean on desktop.
File-by-file highlights
  info.html – Evacuation Information Home
  Shows logo, ReadyLaPlata title, and call center number.
  Queries ArcGIS for a distinct list of incidents and renders them as clickable chips.
  Provides static educational cards for Ready / Set / Go and CodeRED signup.
  Clicking a chip opens evac.html?incident=ThatIncident.
evac.html – Incident Map & Live Status
  Reads ?incident= from the URL.
  Uses ArcGIS WebMap to show the incident map with Search and Fullscreen widgets.
  Queries evac zones to build SET and GO cards with zone chips.
  Calls the Apps Script URL with ?incident=... and injects the returned HTML into the status panel.
  Rebuilds incident chips (like info.html) so users can switch incidents directly from the map.
shared-styles.css – Shared Design System
  Defines the card layout, typography, colors, and spacing for both pages.
  Styles the header, incident strip, chips, SET/GO cards, and status cards.
  Includes responsive tweaks so the UI works well on mobile devices.
  Normalizes the look of the HTML that comes back from Apps Script via .status-html.
Google Apps Script – IncidentStatus HTML Service
  Entry point: doGet(e) expects ?incident=....
  Looks up the matching row in the IncidentStatus sheet.
  Builds a set of mini-cards for:
  Status update link
  Check-in location(s)
  Shelters
  Road closures
  Small and large animal evacuation info (with “Get directions” links)
  Caches each incident’s HTML for 15 seconds to keep things fast and reduce Sheet reads.
  Returns ready-to-inject HTML that evac.html drops into the page under the map.
